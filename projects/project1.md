For project 1 we were supposed to come up with a software application where the central interaction uses two buttons and only two buttons, such that the application and
interaction represent some aspect(s) of one of your group members.
We decided to base the project off of Aman. This teammate is particularly passionate about anime and competitive gaming, so we designed an application that channels these elements. The game we developed is inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" mechanic but with a unique twist to make it more engaging and reflective of the person it represents.

This is a 2-player game in which each player controls either player 1 or player 2. When the game starts, each player has 3 lives. Players can make moves in an attempt to beat their opponent similar to 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'
The moves in our game are "Attack, Parry, Grab, and Block. Attack beats block and grab, parry beats attack, grab beats block, and block beats parry.
Player 1 gets to go first, and can click on the buttons on screen to attack. If he clicks on attack, his character will throw a punch. If he clicks on parry his character will parry. He can also hold down either of these buttons for the other moves. If he holds down attack, he will instead block, if he holds down parry he will grab.

The game ends when either player runs out of hearts.
