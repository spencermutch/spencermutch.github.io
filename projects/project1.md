For project 1 we were to come up with a software application where the central interaction uses two buttons and only two buttons, such that the application and
interaction represent some aspect(s) of one of your group members.
We decided to base the project off of Aman. This teammate is particularly passionate about anime and competitive gaming, so we designed an application that channels these elements. The game we developed is inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" mechanic but with a unique twist to make it more engaging and reflective of the person it represents.

This is a 2-player game in which each player controls either player 1 or player 2. When the game starts, each player has 3 lives. Players can make moves in an attempt to beat their opponent similar to 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'
The moves in our game are "Attack, Parry, Grab, and Block. Attack beats block and grab, parry beats attack, grab beats block, and block beats parry.
Player 1 gets to go first, and can click on the buttons on screen to attack. If he clicks on attack, his character will throw a punch. If he clicks on parry his character will parry. He can also hold down either of these buttons for the other moves. If he holds down attack, he will instead block, if he holds down parry he will grab.

The game ends when either player runs out of hearts.

This image shows one of the refined sketches I worked on for a potential iteration of our project. This idea used auto battler mechanics and had cards you could earn and use in game.

**Overall Description:**
Our project centers around a simple two-button game that reflects the competitive nature and gaming interests of one of our group members. This teammate is particularly passionate about anime and competitive gaming, so we designed an application that channels these elements. The game we developed is inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" mechanic but with a unique twist to make it more engaging and reflective of the person it represents.

The game has four interaction options instead of three, with actions labeled as Attack, Parry, Grab, and Block, which align with traditional fighting games. Each action has specific counters and interactions, adding a layer of strategy beyond the usual triangle interaction of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This diamond-shaped interaction captures both the competitive spirit and nostalgia for old-school fighting games that our teammate loves. The characters featured in the game are also pulled from anime and games that were important to our teammate, creating a personal connection to the application.

The two buttons serve as input for player decisions, with each press prompting a real-time interaction between the two characters on screen, representing the player's chosen action. The game's aesthetic is designed to evoke the look and feel of classic arcade fighting games, with a simple yet visually engaging interface.

**How We Chose Which Idea to Refine:**
As a group, we started by discussing our personalities, hobbies, and interests to come up with ideas that would reflect one of us in the final product. After each person shared their sketches and ideas, we collectively agreed that the gaming/competitive nature of one of our group members offered the most engaging concept. There were two major ideas on the table: a Rock, Paper, Scissors-type game and an auto-battler gacha game. Both ideas reflected our teammate's love for gaming and competition, but the simplicity and accessibility of the Rock, Paper, Scissors concept made it stand out.

We also received strong feedback from other groups that supported this choice. While both ideas captured the essence of our teammate’s personality, we decided to push the Rock, Paper, Scissors concept further by adding a fourth element, which transformed the interaction into a diamond shape and made the game feel more strategic. This evolution from a basic three-action system into a more nuanced four-action game allowed us to maintain simplicity while still making the game more intriguing and in line with our teammate’s competitive nature. We ultimately chose the diamond interaction over the autobattler concept because it added depth without overwhelming the two-button constraint, and the nostalgic fighting game theme resonated more strongly with our group

**How the Application Fits the Objective:**
The project’s objective was to create a software application using only two buttons that would reflect some aspect of one of our group members. Our final product perfectly fits this objective by transforming the two-button interaction into a dynamic, competitive game that embodies our teammate's love for anime, gaming, and friendly competition.

By incorporating elements of nostalgia through old-school fighting game mechanics and beloved characters from his favorite anime and games, the application goes beyond a mere two-button interaction. It becomes a fun and personal experience that captures our teammate’s personality and interests, while still adhering to the project’s technical constraints. The buttons represent a minimal yet highly interactive way to play the game, reinforcing the requirement of limiting interaction to only two inputs, while making the experience engaging enough to "knock socks off" with its creativity and personality.

**How did we work as a team:**
Each of us came up with our own concept sketches before coming together as a group to review them. During this time we discussed what we liked about all of our sketches and ways that we could use different aspects of each of our sketches in our project. This is how we decided how and which sketches we would refine. Throughout the design process we made frequent contact to ensure that each of us had input on the design. While building our project we communicated often about what each of us were working on and made sure to discuss any changes we made.

**What worked:** 
The diamond interaction was effective in creating a dynamic gameplay loop, and the incorporation of familiar anime characters heightened the personal connection for our teammate

**What didn't:**
We initially struggled with balancing the timing of button responses, which led to some frustration during testing. Also, more time could have been spent refining the game's visuals

**What we would change:**
In hindsight, we could have made the game more customizable, allowing players to switch out characters or adjust the difficulty level. We also think adding audio feedback for each action would enhance the gaming experience
