  <h2><b>Individual Proxemic Project:</b></h2>
<p>For this assignment, we were tasked with developing an application using proxemics. We had the option to choose from the following categories: <br>

1. A mobile interface for a “smart” object. Turn a non-smart object into a “smart” object.<br>

2. A stationary display that solves a problem in your home.<br>

3. An application that helps support a multi-person in-person situation.<br>

4. Choose your own idea.<br><br>

I chose to focus on option 2, creating a stationary display that addresses a specific problem in my home, while incorporating elements from option 1.

  <b>Which sketch to choose?</b>
<p>
  Out of all of my initial sketches, two of them felt as though they addressed real problems in my day to day life, The forgetful sketch, where the application would list off the items you needed to remember, and you needed to take the items away from in front of the camera before you left or the system would alert you, and the wardrobe planner sketch where the mirror would detect the clothing you’re wearing and give tips based on weather. While these were both okay ideas, I still felt as though they didn’t have enough use of proxemics and that their functionality was limited. For these reasons I combined the two into a new idea. <br><br>
  </p>

<div class="content">
  <b>Problem</b>
<p>
  As someone who struggles with mornings, I often find myself waking up in a rush, forgetting things, and feeling generally disorganized. To solve this problem, I designed the <b>Smart Mirror</b>. A mirror that helps the users get ready, while keeping them organized and on schedule.
  </p>

  <div class="content">
  <h2><b>Smart Mirror</b></h2>
<p>
  <p>
  The Smart Mirror is designed to blend the functionality of a traditional mirror with smart capabilities, helping users stay organized and prepared for the day ahead. While the user is not standing directly in front of the mirror, a tranquil ambient screen covers the surface, displaying useful information such as the date, time, and weather, helping the user prepare for the day ahead. <br><br>

When the user approaches and looks at the mirror, it greets them and switches to mirror mode, clearing all non-essential information to ensure the user can focus on getting ready. To help the user stay organized, if they move closer to the mirror, their daily schedule will appear on the screen along with reminders for items they need to bring, like a notebook or water bottle. These reminders initially show as unchecked, and the user can check them off by physically showing the items to the mirror. The mirror identifies and tracks these items using markers. <br><br>

By seamlessly integrating into the user’s morning routine, these features ensure that they stay on time, don’t forget any essential items, and always know what's ahead of them for the day, which solves my original problem.

<h3><b>Thoughts on the Project:</b></h3>
<p>
  <b>How the application fits the objective:</b><br>
The objective for this project was to create an application that uses proxemics and in my case, is a stationary display that solves a problem in my home. The problem I chose was that I struggle with mornings and I’m often forgetful and disorganized. My Smart Mirror application solves these problems using multiple proxemic interactions such as distance (To decide which setting to be in, ambient, mirror, or schedule/reminders), Orientation (If the user is looking away from the mirror it goes into ambient mode), and Identity (by recognizing items to check them off in the reminders list).
<br><br>

<b>What worked:</b><br>
The method I used for distance tracking (estimation based on face tracking), worked surprisingly well for this use case and allows for seamless transitions into the various modes. In the end I was also surprised by just how useful this mirror could actually be for me if I was able to implement it as a finished system in a real mirror. Having all of this useful information in one place works really well.<br><br>

<b>What didn’t:</b><br>
I would have liked to use machine learning to identify objects instead of using markers, however this added a performance hit to my application and the item recognition wasn’t perfect so I opted to use markers instead. The camera on my laptop also made testing and using the program difficult as the webcam is low quality, and the field of view is very low which makes keeping my face as well as objects I’m trying to check off in the frame difficult.<br><br>

<b>What I would change:</b><br>
Given more time I would like to find a working solution to use machine learning item recognition instead of markers. I would have also liked to add functionality for multiple users, such as facial recognition so that multiple users could use the mirror and have their own personal schedule and reminders, as well as the functionality to split the mirror into multiple segments so multiple people could use it at the same time.
